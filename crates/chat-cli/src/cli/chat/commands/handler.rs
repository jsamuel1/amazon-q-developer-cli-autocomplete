/// CommandHandler Trait
///
/// The CommandHandler trait defines the interface for all command handlers in the Q chat system.
/// Each command handler is responsible for parsing, validating, and executing a specific command.
///
/// # Design Philosophy
///
/// The CommandHandler trait follows these key principles:
///
/// 1. **Encapsulation**: Each handler encapsulates all knowledge about a specific command,
///    including its name, description, usage, parsing logic, and execution behavior.
///
/// 2. **Single Responsibility**: Each handler is responsible for one command and does it well.
///
/// 3. **Extensibility**: The trait is designed to be extended with new methods as needed, such as
///    `to_command` for converting arguments to a Command enum.
///
/// # Command Parsing and Execution
///
/// The trait separates command parsing from execution:
///
/// - `to_command`: Converts string arguments to a Command enum variant
/// - `execute`: Default implementation that delegates to `to_command` and wraps the result in a
///   ChatState
/// - `execute_command`: Works directly with Command objects for type-safe execution
///
/// This separation allows tools like internal_command to leverage the parsing logic
/// without duplicating code, while preserving the execution flow for direct command invocation.
